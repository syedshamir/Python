    "Recursion\n",
    "Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself (\"recurse\"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it."
